Hello Vipin,
‘Money can’t buy happiness.’ We beg to differ. With everyone going cashless, it’s time to join the brigade. Get a Credit Card, mate!  
Experiences Matter Spending on experiences rather than material things tends to make you happier. For example, shopping alone versus a hiking trip with friends. What makes you happier?
A Smile Is Worth Millions Do something to make someone smile. Being the reason for someone else’s happiness is a great feeling. Every little effort counts.
Buy Time And Use It We’re not talking about a time machine, duh! Take a vacation with the ones who matter to you or go solo. Travelling can make you happy.
Little Joys > Expensive Stuff Spend more on the simple joys of life. A long drive, your favourite ice cream and someone you love. It beats shopping for expensive stuff. See? Money can make you happy if you use it right - with the perfect Credit Card, of course!
